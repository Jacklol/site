            <h4>Money2Game</h4><br/>
            <p>
              Problem: Gamers wanted to buy "gold" without spending a cent. 

Solution: We co-founded our 1st startup - Mining of game currency Online. We have emitted "beardeer" e-coins. User earned e-coins by task execution or mining, then exchanged coins to game gold or rubles. Our wallet was integrated with WMmail tasks stock, dozens of Games, payment aggregators. Additionally we invented a Cryptocurrency miner.

            <h4>Payday Loans Engine</h4><br/>
            <p>Problem: It took up to one year and significant amount of resources to automate every new Lending Company business process. The task was to improve this process and save company money. 

Solution: We have refactored the existing solution and invented a unified core engine that was customizable in a month with much less effort. As a result company's revenue skyrocketed. Our solution was integrated with major Russian Credit Bureaus.</p>
